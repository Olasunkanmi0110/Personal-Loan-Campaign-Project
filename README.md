The Personal Loan Campaign Project aims to identify potential customers likely to accept personal loan offers. Using historical customer data—such as age, income, education, credit card usage, and account activity—banks apply data mining techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build predictive models. These models help target marketing efforts more effectively, reducing campaign costs and increasing conversion rates. For instance, instead of sending promotional emails to all clients, the bank focuses on high-probability responders, ensuring resources are used efficiently while improving customer experience through personalised, relevant financial product offerings.
